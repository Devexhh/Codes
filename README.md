# Numerical Methods in C++

This repository contains solutions to a variety of numerical methods commonly used in numerical analysis, all implemented using C++. These methods are fundamental tools in scientific computing and are widely used for solving mathematical problems such as finding roots of equations, solving systems of linear equations, interpolation, numerical differentiation and integration, and more.

It consists of
- Bisection Method
